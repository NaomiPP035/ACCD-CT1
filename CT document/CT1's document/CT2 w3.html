  <p>I am image what would a phone stand be like in future, becasue sometime I am mad about the phone stand now, it's hard, difficult to use and what's the most important I cannot put the phone stand wherever I want. So I assumed in the minimalism future, phone stand will simulate octopus tentacles, but they will be made of a material similar to liquid glass, which allows the phone stand to be shaped freely.</p><br><br><br><br>

  <p>I made a shape similar to "being randomly stretched a bit after being put in a car", and I want to try adding an internal structure to it. </p><br><br><br><br>
  <img src="pics/22.png" alt="second step"><br>
  <p>I tried to let "fist" pose is "stop", otherwise user could only keep drawing and drawing, but "fist" pose is just "when the tops of five fingers are really close to the center of palm, it is "fist", hand would probably look like fist during painting.</p>
  <img src="pics/33.png" alt="third step"><br> 
  <p>So what about only one index finger as "pen", and if another index finger show up, it means "pause"? I think this idea is perfect and it worked, it worked terribly. Unfortunely for now neither has "pause" nor "two finger painting".</p>
