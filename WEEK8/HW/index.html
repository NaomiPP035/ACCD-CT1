<h1>FORCREATE - a very accurate and advanced drawing tool</h1>

  <p>At first I wanted to use my mouse as the contoller of my interative webpage,like I need physically "click". But suddently I realized why don't I just use my hands?</p><br> So, I decide to create a very original drawing tool that couldonly use hands, I would say it's more like a two dimentional VR painting tool.<br> For now it's a canvas that you can paint with five fingers.<br>

  <img src="1.png" alt="first step"><br>
  <p>Original idea was let it recognize which exact finger user is using, but I failed. It could only use two index finger now. </p>
  <img src="2.png" alt="second step"><br>
  <p>I tried to let "fist" pose is "stop", otherwise user could only keep drawing and drawing, but "fist" pose is just "when the tops of five fingers are really close to the center of palm, it is "fist", hand would probably look like fist during painting.</p>
  <img src="3.png" alt="third step"><br> 
  <p>So what about only one index finger as "pen", and if another index finger show up, it means "pause"? I think this idea is perfect and it worked, it worked terribly. Unfortunely for now neither has "pause" nor "two finger painting".</p>

  <p>I want my UI layout looks exactly like this and indeed it does. Dring next week I need do more about it.</p>
