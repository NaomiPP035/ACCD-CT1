  <h1 class="title">WEEK6 - Interactive System with UI</h1>
  <div>Firstly I find I don’t know how to let my images perfectly fit with circles, but I just let the images’ size be “radius*2, radius*2”, it looks great. I also tried to let my balls bound more powerful, because it won’t bounce back although I write the code to let it bound back once they reach the edge.
  <br><br>
  I raise velocity from maximum of 3 to maximum of 12. The most interesting problem I met is that sometimes when I run the sketch, it says” images was expecting number for the third parameter, received NaN instead. I found out later it’s because sketch tries to run before image loads.
  <br><br>
  I got several solutions, one is a code says “If the image has not been fully loaded yet, return directly”, one is give the image a proper size(I let image be double of radius). I tried both but none of them work. I leave it like that and decide to change the initial place of images first. But I don’t know why right after I add the codes of let images be at random space of canvas’s top, the “loading” problem solved.</div>
