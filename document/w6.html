  <h1 class="title">WEEK6 - Interactive System with UI and Seminar Reading</h1>
  <div>Firstly I find I don’t know how to let my images perfectly fit with circles, but I just let the images’ size be “radius*2, radius*2”, it looks great. I also tried to let my balls bound more powerful, because it won’t bounce back although I write the code to let it bound back once they reach the edge.
  <br><br>
  I raise velocity from maximum of 3 to maximum of 12. The most interesting problem I met is that sometimes when I run the sketch, it says” images was expecting number for the third parameter, received NaN instead. I found out later it’s because sketch tries to run before image loads.
  <br><br>
  I got several solutions, one is a code says “If the image has not been fully loaded yet, return directly”, one is give the image a proper size(I let image be double of radius). I tried both but none of them work. I leave it like that and decide to change the initial place of images first. But I don’t know why right after I add the codes of let images be at random space of canvas’s top, the “loading” problem solved.</div>

  <div>What do prototypes prototype?</div><br>
  <div>Apple’s researchers gave this laptop prototype to an architect to carry on for a day, to see if its size and shape ok. I am surprised that this prototype is so simple but efficient, it’s just a pizza box with additional weight, but helped them so much that they found need a softer form. Sometimes efficiency doesn’t have to cost a lot of work.</div>

  <div>It’s a very specific prototype that almost looks the same as a real one. Designers create this prototype in order to let the public could try it easily. Compare it to others, misunderstand happens rarely.</div>

  <div>This prototype perfectly response sentence “Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions.” In order to reflect its overall features instead of its design. But this hand-drawn graphics inspire team members and even make them consider about use it in final project.</div>

  <div>Programming Design System</div><br>
  <div>It’s two rectangle gradient experiment, the former uses HSL but the latter uses HSLuv, although it’s frequently used to let colorful texts easy to read, but I think the colors are too dirty and I wonder if there is better solution.</div>

  <div> This two images was created by Bézier functions. When coding, I’m not able to know how many Beziers I need  without exercising, I am little confused that why it couldn’t simplify it just like adobe illustrator.</div>

  <div>This chapter is about color scheme, although we can decide and change it easily by coding, I am curious about why houses of Japanese use muted color but Mexican uses pure colors, why author used this example.</div>
